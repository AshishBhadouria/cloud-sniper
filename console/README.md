## *Cloud Security Operations*

### *Cloud Sniper*

***Cloud Sniper*** will allow you to concentrate your security operations management in a friendly visual console.

The beta version of this console lets you analyze security findings in any of your AWS account.
The investigation process starts with a comprehensive visual classification of all the incidents found, identified by attack purpose and thread type. From there, you can see which are the affected instances and the raw information generated by GuardDuty.

[A preliminary DEMO video of the console UI is available here.](https://youtu.be/N1H0nZGwyjQ)
