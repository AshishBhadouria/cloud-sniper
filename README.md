### *What is Cloud Sniper?*

***Cloud Sniper*** is a platform designed to manage Cloud Security Operations. It is a  platform intended to respond to security incidents by accurately analyzing and correlating native cloud artifacts. It is to be used as a Cloud Security Operations Platform to detect and remediate security incidents by showing a complete visibility of the company's cloud security posture.

With this platform, you have a complete and comprehensive management of the security incidents. At the same time Cloud Sniper lets advanced security analysts integrate the platform with external forensic or incident-and-response tools to provide security feeds into the platform. The platform automatically deploys and provides cloud-based integration with all native resources, is fully modularized and very easy to extend for the community.

***Cloud Sniper*** receives and processes cloud-based and third-parties feeds and automatically responds protecting the infrastructure. To detect advanced attack techniques, ***Cloud Sniper Analytics*** module correlates the events generating *IOCs*, helping to analyze the attacker's *TTPs*.

*Is currently available for AWS, but it is to be extended to others cloud platforms.*
