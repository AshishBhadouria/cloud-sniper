## *Cloud Sniper Analytics module*

***Cloud Sniper*** introduces an analytics module to analyze data, metrics and telemetry generated on the cloud. This first version analyzes VPC flows to detect beaconing (call home) patterns.

VPC-Flowlogs stored on S3 are analyzed by the beaconing module, looking for beaconing patterns in those flows.
