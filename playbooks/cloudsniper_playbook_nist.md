    <details>
            <summary>ID.AM</summary>
    The data, personnel, devices, systems, and facilities that enable the organization to achieve business purposes are identified and managed consistent with their relative importance to business objectives and the organizationâ€™s risk strategy
    </details>

    1.  **IAM**
        
        1.  Checks whether IAM groups have at least one IAM user
            **#IDENTIFY**            

        2.  Checks whether IAM users are members of at least one IAM group
            **#IDENTIFY**
        
        3.  Checks that none of the IAM users have policies attached. IAM users must inherit permissions from IAM groups or roles
            **#IDENTIFY**

        4.  Checks whether your Identity and IAM users have passwords or active access keys that have not been used within the specified number of days you provided
            **#IDENTIFY**

    2.  **Security groups**
    
        1.  Checks that the default security group of any VPC does not allow inbound or outbound traffic
            **#IDENTIFY**

    2.  **ACM Certificates**
    
        1.  Checks whether ACM Certificates in your account are marked for expiration within the specified number of days
            **#IDENTIFY**

    3.  **KMS**

        1.  Checks whether the active access keys are rotated within the number of days specified in maxAccessKeyAge
            **#IDENTIFY**

    4.  **CloudTrail**

        1.  Checks whether CloudTrail is enabled in your account
            **#IDENTIFY**

        2. Checks whether CloudTrail trails are configured to send logs to CloudWatch logs
            **#IDENTIFY**

        3. Checks whether CloudTrail is configured to use the server side encryption (SSE-KMS)
            **#IDENTIFY**

        4. Checks whether CloudTrail creates a signed digest file with logs
            **#IDENTIFY**

        5. Checks that there is at least one multi-region CloudTrail
            **#IDENTIFY**

    5.  **GuardDuty**

        1.  Checks whether GuardDuty is enabled in your account and region
