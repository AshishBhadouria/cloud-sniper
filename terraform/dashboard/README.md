## *Cloud Sniper Dashboard module*

***Cloud Sniper*** introduces an dashboard stack to visualize data, metrics and telemetry generated by cloudsniper. The dashboard is an kibana exported object located into the dashboard folder, if you already have a ELK just import the logs using logstash (pipeline into ./dashboard/logstash) and import the saved object to start visualizing your cloudsniper finding.

This stack include all that you need to run ELK into an EC2 with opendistro and all 

To deploy the full Cloud Sniper Dashboard stack, you should run:

1.  ~$ git clone https://github.com/cloud-sniper/cloud-sniper.git
2.  ~$ cd cloud-sniper/dashboard
3.  Set the environment variables corresponding to the account in the variables.tf file
4.  Create main.tf
5.  ~/cloud-sniper/dashboard$ terraform init
6.  ~/cloud-sniper/dashboard$ terraform plan
7.  set your aws ssh-key for get access to the instance and your VPC-ID. (the EC2 access is restricted to the current public IP) 
8.  ~/cloud-sniper/dashboard$ terraform apply [yes]
9.  when the EC2 instance is initialized, you have to manually copy the /dashboard/logstash/logstash.conf file inside '/etc/logstash/conf.d/logstash.conf'. *Remember put your s3 folder name and setup with your user/password*.
